This is the most important example of the project here. It shows the usage of
almost all aspects combined:

* The usage of ASAN on plugins and rust to find issues
* The exposure of a rust api via C ffi, and headers.
* plugins in C and Rust to consume that api
* a plugin controller that opens those plugins and executes their callbacks
  as required.

You can build the project with the configure and makefile in the root of
this folder.
